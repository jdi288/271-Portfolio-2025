My thought process for creating my story map for an app that delivers groceries involved me getting into the head of a user that would be using the app. to do this I imagined myself using the app and what features I would fine convenient. This is why I included things such as a large library of food to choose from and an interface thatâ€™s easy to enter in credit cards to pay. For the MVP release i choose tasks that were strictly necessary for the app to begin testing that is why it included tasks such a search bar for food, accurate pricing and a delivery driver to deliver food.  The more polished second release includes things such as tracking on the order and emailed receipts of the food

One choice I made was having the ability to track the delivery of the food on the go, this feature is taken from amazon, and I decided to include this as its very convenient to have a live feed to better inform the customer when their foods arriving. This is shown through the task add tracker to app

Another choice I made was to ensure the site is user friendly and appeals to the most amount of people. One way this comes through in the design in by allows a variety of credit cards to connect to the site as a payment method ensures a large amount of people can use the service.

Another choice I made was to include not only a way to search for food by also a flyer section so people can browse and possible be able to find even more groceries conveniently. This is shown in the story board where the MVP has only the search feature since its easier to implement and test. However in the polished release there should be a feature that allows people to browse photos of the food as well as deals offered.

I tried a couple features out including using colour coding to better distinguish important tasks, as well as putting a priority on how important certain tasks are, the point of this would be to highlight which tasks need more care put upon them in the building portion of the design.
